# UNAUHENTICATED ENUM DEFENSE (SSRF)

SSRF vulnerability is a classic attack path for vulnerabilities related to Cloud infrastructures.

 ![SSRF]([https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelGaudemer/GCP-Pentest/main/GCP%20PENTEST%20NEW.png](https://www.vaadata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SSRF-FR.jpg) "SSRF")
 
 Injetion a malicious URL into a vulnerable application in an input cal allow attacker to access local ressource, it allows attacker to bypass mesaures in place to protect internal systems and ressources.
 
 **Google Cloud Armor** can protect google cloud project.
 
 Possible to add rules in this **Google Cloud Armor** module to prevent attack.

# STORAGE BUCKET (S3) SCOUT SUITE

Buckets store all data and have to be protected to prevent information leak and motivate attacker. 

[**SCOUTSUITE**](https://github.com/nccgroup/ScoutSuite) open source security tool. [**SCOUT SUITE**](https://github.com/nccgroup/ScoutSuite) audit the solution and display the vulnerabilities.

```
$ virtualenv -p python3 env
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install scoutsuite
$ scout --help
$ scout gcp --user-account --project-id GCP-PROJECT-ID
```

Can detect that bucket is accessible in public access with misconfigured policy, suggest you to prevent public access to a sensible bucket and fix roles & permission to prevent vulnerabilities (only authorize get request instead of get & set).
